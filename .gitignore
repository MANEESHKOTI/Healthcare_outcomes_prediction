# Model & Data Artifacts
# We are NOT ignoring data/ because your Dashboard needs the CSVs to run online.
# We are NOT ignoring .pkl files because your Dashboard needs the Model/Scaler.

# If you had massive files (>100MB), you would ignore them here, 
# but your stroke dataset is small (~300KB), so it is safe to upload everything.
